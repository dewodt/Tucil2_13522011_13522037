## Short Description

Bézier curves are smooth curves often used in graphic design, animation, and manufacturing. These curves are created by connecting several control points, which determine the shape and direction of the curve. The way to do it is quite easy, namely by determining control points and connecting them with curves.

Bézier curves have many uses in real life, such as pen tools, smooth and realistic animations, creating complex and precise product designs, and creating beautiful and unique fonts. The advantage of using Bézier curves is that they are easy to change and manipulate, so they can produce precise designs that suit your needs.

A Bézier curve is defined by a set of control points P0 to Pn, with n called the order (n = 1 for linear, n = 2 for quadratic, and so on). The first and last control points are always the ends of the curve, but intermediate control points (if any) generally do not lie on the curve.

## Requirements

- Python 3.10
- Tkinter
- Turtle Graphics

## Features

- Generate n-th order Bezier curve using bruteforce or divide and conquer.
- Animate Bezier curve generation.
